# Setting up Zeek Virtual Machine

The following directory will provide a bash script to install Zeek software in the `zeek-vm`. The script must be run with `sudo` rights.

When completed, move on to [mininet-vm-setup](../mininet-vm-setup/README.md), when all VM setup is completed, you can move on to [zeek-scripts](../../zeek-scripts/README.md) directory on a brief introduction of the Zeek scripting language and its use in detection and prevention of cyber-threats.

`TODO`: Maybe also need to provide documentation on installing Python and other required libraries for the API in Zeek VM?
